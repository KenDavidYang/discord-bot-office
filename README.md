# OfficeBot

Hello! To give a bit of background on **OfficeBot**. This started as side project to encourage my co-workers to migrate to discord and have a little bit of Fun along the way. Added features that was requested or tasks that I saw a need for and was appropriate to add as a feature. One such example are slash commands for our Fabula Ultima Sessions.

## Sample Commands
 - !help -> To get a full list of commands and features 
 - /stats -> calculate your Fabula Ultima Stats!
 - !hello -> say hello!
 - !cookie -> gives you a daily cookie!
 - !pokemon <pokemon_name>

## Closing Remarks

As this project has grown larger, the feelings of frustration and satisfaction came along with it. I hope to continue adding features and make this something that everyone can have fun over.
